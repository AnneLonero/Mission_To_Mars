# Mission_To_Mars

## Overview
We scrape Mars NASA news site (https://redplanetscience.com/) using automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beatiful Soup to extract various types of information. These include HTML tables, recurring elements like multiple news articles title and preview text. We will then organize, analyze and visualize the data that we extracted.

## Results

The distance from peak to peak is roughly 1425-750, or 675 days. A year on Mars appears to be about 675 days from the plot. Internet search confirms that a Mars year is equivalent to 687 earth days.
